# ShadUI ✨

ShadUI (shad·UI /ˈʃæd juː aɪ/) is an **Avalonia-based Desktop UI Library** inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
and [Suki UI Library](https://kikipoulet.github.io/SukiUI/).  
Our goal is to deliver a modern, beautiful, and intuitive UI library for [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/).
